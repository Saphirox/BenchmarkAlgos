Counting sort vs AVL tree sorting

Summary
1. Counting sort is not performing when the range is very big. For example, python can run out of memory for allocating a big chunk of memory
2. AVL performs better on a smaller array size and the number range is big

Range between o and max python array size 
AVL performs better on a small array. Counting sort performs better overall
